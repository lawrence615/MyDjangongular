### MyDjangongular

MyDjangongular is a project I undertook to practise my skills in both Angular 2 and Django 1.9. Am still learning so there might be
some few things that are not done right. To set up the project,follow the steps below.

####To install Django:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

####To run test server:

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    python manage.py runserver

####To install Angular 2 and other assets:

    npm install

####Then start gulp on a different tab

    gulp
